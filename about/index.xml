      <description>Introduction Link to heading Hi!&#xA;This is Xin Xiong, a neophyte of OS (security) research, currently studying in secsys lab at Fudan University. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some researchs about bug detection in OS kernels with static analysis and fuzzing since 2020.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m quite intrigued by the magic of OS itself, which drives me crazy and yen to explore more in depth.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m also enthralled by the kaleidoscopic real-world kernel exploitations, which I quite enjoy analyzing it though not being able to do it myself :(</description>
