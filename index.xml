      <description>TL;DR Link to heading Recently, when drawing graphs with mermaid in Typora 1.8.10, it’s always showing “Painting Diagram…” and stuck forever. The problem doesn’t happen for other diagram renderers, namely, Flowchart and Sequence. It also works fine for modern macOS like Sonoma.&#xA;When I visit the official website, I finds that the latest recommended version for macOS Catalina is 1.4.8, and the version does work fine.As someone who relies on Typora pretty heavily and do not get away from the excellent new features like alert boxes, I decided to dive into this problem.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Hi!&#xA;This is Xin Xiong, a neophyte of OS (security) research, currently studying in secsys lab at Fudan University. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some researchs about bug detection in OS kernels with static analysis and fuzzing since 2020. And I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted some modest patches to Linux kernel, most of which accepted by developers.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m quite intrigued by the magic of OS itself, which drives me crazy and yen to explore more in depth.</description>
